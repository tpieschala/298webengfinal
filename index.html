It implements the cost-effectiveness and power of a Raspberry Pi and combines it with the ease of use and efficiency of Wix Velo, as well as the powerful communications solution Twilio. After a USB drive is inserted into the system, it is automatically mounted and scanned using the open source ClamAV antivirus software. A report is then generated, parsed and uploaded to the Wix Velo database. It is also messaged to the user through Twilio for a concise overview. Reports can be reviewed at any time by anyone logged into the organizationâ€™s Guardsman account.</p></div></a>
